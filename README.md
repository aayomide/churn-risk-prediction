# Customer Churn Prediction
## Problem
A small-sized startup is keen on reducing its customer churn and has hired you as a Machine Learning engineer for this task. Churn rate is a marketing metric that describes the number of customers who leave a business over a specific time period. Every user is assigned a prediction value that estimates their state of churn at any given time. This value is based on:
- User demographic information
- Browsing behavior
- Historical purchase data among other information

## Task
As an expert, you are required to build a sophisticated Machine Learning model that predicts the churn score for a website based on multiple features.

## Data description
The dataset folder contains the following files:
- train.csv: 36992 x 25
- test.csv: 19919 x 24

The columns provided in the dataset are as follows:

## Setup
For this project, having a Python version less than v3.12 on your system is preferable to avoid compatibility issues during dependencies installation. Python 3.10.11 was used in the project. <br>
Check your Python version by inputting `python --version` in the command-line prompt.

Follow these steps to set up the development environment for the churn prediction project:
1. Create a Project Directory:
    - Open your terminal and create a new directory on your local machine called churn_prediction: `mkdir churn_prediction`
2. Navigate to this new Project Directory: `cd churn_prediction`
3. Create a Python virtual environment inside the churn_prediction directory: `python -m venv .venv`
4. Activate the Virtual Environment: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
5. While still in the churn_prediction directory, clone this project repository into your local: `git clone https://github.com/aayomide/churn-risk-prediction.git`
6. Navigate to the Cloned Repository: `cd churn-risk-prediction`
7. Install all required dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
8. Start the Web Application. Run the following command to start the Flask web application: `flask run`
